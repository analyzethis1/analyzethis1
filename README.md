# 👋🏼 About Me

I'm a passionate **AI/ML engineer**, **data scientist**, and **vibe coder** focused on blending cutting-edge machine learning with real-time interfaces and DevOps practices. My work revolves around **time series forecasting**, **predictive maintenance**, and building **interactive tools** that turn data into actionable insights.

I specialize in making complex systems **scalable, interpretable, and user-friendly**—whether that’s predicting energy usage, exploring databases with natural language, or automating chart generation with Apple-level polish.
