# 👋🏼 About Me

I'm a passionate **AI/ML engineer**, **data scientist**, and **vibe coder** focused on turning raw data into high-impact, interactive products. My work blends **machine learning**, **real-time interfaces**, and **DevOps** to make analytics not just functional but intuitive, scalable, and visually compelling.

I specialize in:
- **Time series forecasting** and **predictive maintenance** for real-time decision-making
- **Human-centered data tools** that deliver executive-ready outputs instantly
- Architecting **scalable, privacy-first systems** that run anywhere—from laptops to Kubernetes clusters
